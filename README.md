Upload Images with Node.js and Multer

This sample shows you how to upload images on the frontend and how to store them in the file system of a server/backend. One of the easiest ways to do this is with a package named Multer. Multer is a Node.js middleware used for handling multimedia, which is primarily used for uploading images.

To run this application, follow these steps:

- Download the zip folder or clone the repository

- Run "npm install" on your VS code terminal (to install all of the dependencies).

- Run "npm run server" on your VS code terminal (to start the application).
